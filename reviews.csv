Carefully sourced Brazilian and Ethiopia single-origin roasts and a two-bean blend from Costa Rica and Panama have been alloted to cold filter, espresso and milk-based drinks respectively.

The Blue Cup is probably dominating the artisan coffee game in this city.

I don't know what he was saying, but he was gesturing towards us and the bartender was laughing awkwardly.

Once we had our drinks, we went outside and tried to find a seat. We saw someone sitting alone with 3 empty seats by him, and went over and asked if we could take the spare seats. He said there was someone sitting opposite, so we asked to take the two seats next to them, and he said ""Sorry, it's for 2 people."" So we said, ""Well, if we don't use the table, can we please take the chairs?"" he said that was OK, so we pulled the seats a short distance from the table and sat down, already feeling very awkward.

And didn't dissapoint us.. the service was amazingly fast, our waiter was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed and made sure we are satisfied.
About the coctails: we tried a few of them. Still not dissapointed. They have a menu with pictures of the drinks and what you get is looks just the same good as in the pics and all of what we tried was tasted very good.
So unique atmosphere in the heart of Thessaloniki with great service and good drinks.",5.0

Northwich, United Kingdom","August 21, 2017",August 2017,Cliquey and unfriendly- go here if you want to feel like the least cool kid at high school!,"When we arrived, the waiter turned and looked at us in a very unpleasant way, like we were doing something wrong. I said we were here for a drink and was that OK? He said ""Excuse me?"" as if I'd said something completely ridiculous. I didn't know how to respond, so we continued and he followed us in and talked to the bartender in Greek as he made our (very expensive!) drinks. I don't know what he was saying, but he was gesturing towards us and the bartender was laughing awkwardly.

Once we had our drinks, we went outside and tried to find a seat. We saw someone sitting alone with 3 empty seats by him, and went over and asked if we could take the spare seats. He said there was someone sitting opposite, so we asked to take the two seats next to them, and he said ""Sorry, it's for 2 people."" So we said, ""Well, if we don't use the table, can we please take the chairs?"" he said that was OK, so we pulled the seats a short distance from the table and sat down, already feeling very awkward. His friend came out and started gesturing at us and shouting. The waiter came out and told us to move to a different table. We had done absolutely nothing wrong and not attempted to bother these people in anyway, just wanted to sit in nearby seats. The waiter was talking to them in an apologetic tone.

We finished our drinks and left as quickly as possible, feeling like we'd been thoroughly rejected.",1.0

I ordered americano and V60. First one was delicious but V60? not so much... I can live with little over or under extractions but that coffee was too much. It was like licking a tire. Its bitterness was overwhelming. As far as I know, in Greece when you don't like something you can send it back and get something else you will enjoy instead, however discouraged by almost an hour wait I had to leave it as it was. Shame, because the place itself looks really interesting and the combination of bar and speciality coffee is a recipe for success.

On our second visit I had a cappachino latte and my husband chose a Fred Capapachino, again delicious. All the coffees were delivered with complimentary biscuits. In addition I ordered a cookie biscuit from the menu. It is very popular with the Greeks which is always a good sign and busy. The prices are very affordable and it is good value for money.

Walnut Creek","January 7, 2019",January 2019,Absolutely unacceptable treatment by staff.,"I entered and said hello to the staff and asked to use the bathroom before I ordered. I was traveling alone and didn't want to leave my stuff behind while I was in the restroom - I do this all the time and have never had a problem. The man working blocked my entrance and told me ""no"" without any explanation. I further explained that I was going to order a coffee, I just wanted to use the bathroom before I sat down. I tried to explain and make him see that I wanted to order something and stay there but he literally stood by the door holding the door open, motioning for me to leave. He then got angry at me, raising his voice to me and telling me, literally, these words: ""this caf√© is different, this place is not for you."" From that, I'm guessing he was angry with me because I'm a tourist and I don't speak Greek. I understand 100% a place wanting you to place an order before you use their bathroom but he didn't even give me an opportunity to order and actually kicked me out of the caf√©, embarrassing me in front of all the other guest there. I've traveled to 60 countries in my life and work in the travel industry, and I have never been kicked out of an establishment before even having a chance to order. The man who was working the day of writing this (January 7th) is a complete embarrassment to hospitality and deserves to lose his job or his business if this is how he believes its acceptable to treat customers.

Secondly the server mentioned that they only accept cash, I found this suspicious. When we ordered Natchos together with our drinks we literally waited 45 minutes, the girl smiled in a weird way and gave no reasonable explanation when asked. It was all very strange, the table next to us had their food after 20 minutes. Then when I paid we were short changed.

First of all, the coffee costs around ‚Ç¨3.50; which is high for Greek standards.

The food menu is very tiny; just a few toast and nothing that stands out.
The sandwich I ordered was fair for the price, but was mostly cheap cheese and soft bread. Others drinks like the chocolate milk (‚Ç¨5.50!) are rich in chocolate, but the balance is off which makes it too heavy to drink.

I would say overall the menu is way overpriced. Just go one street parallel and get much better value for money.

Since it is tucked away, it was a little difficult to find, but I managed to locate it. It was my first morning there after a long flight, and my first morning ever in Greece, so I decided to keep my order simple, and I asked for a decaf coffee with milk. They asked if I wanted medium sugar with it, to which I agreed. They must have pegged me as an American right away. Then they asked if I wanted a frappe. Thinking Starbucks, I said yes. In Greece, that just means over ice. But it was so good, I went back again and got the same thing. Perfect for a warm morning.",5.0

Allegro,mijiale,"June 28, 2020",June 2020,Disappointing,"We had been to Allegro before for a cup of coffee, and decided to go there for dinner. Unfortunately, we were greatly disappointed due to the following reasons:

1. While in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak, the staff was not following any health security measures. The staff's masks did not cover their mouth and nose at any point while serving our food, making us very uncomfortable. Masks should not be just for show or in case an inspection takes place.

2. Not sufficient social distancing. Tables were too close together, and chairs were literally back to back.

3. Food was mediocre. The bruschetti were terrible. The bread was not even the average bread you can get at any local bakery shop, it was ready-made sliced bread, the one you get at the supermarket! The beef tagliata was not great either, we were surprised not being asked how we would like it cooked, in fact it was served overdone.

Overall, it is a nice place to enjoy coffee or drinks with a view, but better spend your money elsewhere for dinner.",2.0

London, United Kingdom","October 30, 2017",October 2017,Fine food spoiled by over-salting,"This place was frustrating. Nice setting, convenient, central, location, good ingredients, very pleasant staff (even if a bit too leisurely, but, hey, not a problem), nice contemporary ambience. We ate there twice, thinking that the over-salting of 3 of our 4 dishes the first night (the fried squid was perfect) would hardly happen again. Next night all four (2 starters, 2 mains) were at least equally over-salted. A mushroom risotto was beautifully flavoured but the overlay of salt made it impossible to finish. Seafood pasta was almost the same. I can only speculate that the chef is a very heavy smoker and so his taste buds need this crazy level of over-seasoning to register. A pity as otherwise the place would be terrific.",3.0

Then we talked to the staff and had a lovely conversation. Christina, the manager, was very nice and gave us some good tips. The cocktail was innovative and very good, although they do not sell special brands of alcohol, more the good standard classics. With the drinks came a plate with some sausage and dip.

The quality of the staff depends on who is here, mostly it is quick, always they are friendly.

The bad thing about this place is, that the sun is shining directly inside, and of you are facing sun, it is getting very very hot instantly, there is no sun shade or whatever, this could be done better.

Give the many coffee varieties a try, or have a long drink, everything is possible.

Coffee Island,ErmaMalekkidou,"November 5, 2017",October 2017,Fast and convenient choice.,"My husband has gone into the coffee shop to get coffee since we would be driving for 2 hours.
He also bought two sandwiches with sliced bread (chicken with parmesan and turkey with cheese) and also a small bag of cookies.
What made me an impression is that both sandwiched have been fresh.
I think he paid less than 10 euros.",5.0

I used to skate pass this building in the early 90s. In the late 90s it became what it is now. It works on many levels either with friends,first dates or solo which is what I prefer with this bar.

The last years they start having bad attitude with customers.
Today was the worst services i ever had.
I tried to have a drink and chill out for a while.
They did 10-15 minutes to give order.
When they brought my drink they asked me to paid.
After 30 minutes waitress came to me and told me that she have to takes my drink and anything that exist on the table.
I didn't understand what see mean and i let here to clean the table.
After that see asked me to give a new order or else that i have to leave and let other to sit down and order.
So she didn't allow me to drink my half finished glass and my last experience was truly awful.
I will not going back there again for any reason.

The service is not rude exactly but kind of forgetful, the girl just kind of doesn‚Äôt see you, she seems a bit lost in thoughts... Then she messes up your order (two drinks, not exactly difficult to remember!), then she overcharges you for both of them. I‚Äôm not sure it was accidental. When you ask for another drink, it takes ages to arrive. The nibbles they usually bring with drinks never arrive. In the end you pay and she gives you back less change. Again, I‚Äôm not sure that too was accidental. So... kind of thinking why I should ever return. Pity though. This place holds a lot of promise as it seems appealing.",2.0
