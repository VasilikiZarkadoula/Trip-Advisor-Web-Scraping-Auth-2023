The bakery also offered a limited menu of sandwiches, salads and other items. I had a toasted pastry with an egg and slices of meat (somewhat like an egg McMuffin without the top). I enjoyed a croissant (flakey, warm from the oven) with my coffee (hot, freshly brewed). The staff was friendly and efficient.

      "Business Name: The Blue Cup\n",
      "In my opinion it is the best place in Thessaloniki for coffee. They have a variety of coffee beans and blends from around the world. Uniquely styled coffee drinks and an excellent house espresso. They also serve other things prepared with the same care and delicacy. The staff is welcoming and polite. In the beginning the place may not look like much but as you sit and enjoy, you understand how special it is. Their selection of alcoholic drinks is as well something to be remarked. Here you can find your new taste but be careful cause then you may no longer be satisfied with other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee is very good and the staff is very friendly. The space is also very well decorated. We tried three types of coffee and all of them were impressive.\n",

      "\n",
      "Recommended by our son, who really knows his coffee. The Blue Cup is well positioned, just on the edge of the Ladadika district. They have an extensive menu of different coffees beans & extraction techniques. Presentation was equally impressive, likened to an old victorian apothecary. All senses were taken on a journey to ensure an enjoyable experience. One of the best!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blue Cup would be a hipster speciality-coffee heaven if it weren’t for its location in the very commercially touristy heart of the City. It’s no surprise, considering how brilliant the coffee is after the research I made before the visit. Carefully sourced Brazilian and Ethiopia single-origin roasts and a two-bean blend from Costa Rica and Panama have been alloted to cold filter, espresso and milk-based drinks respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blue Cup is probably dominating the artisan coffee game in this city. The coffee is made slowly and very precisely, and the extensive menu goes beyond espresso-based drinks – there’s also a lovingly curated list of cold filter coffees on offer at the brew bar which changes depending of coffee imports they have.\n",
      "A day exploring Thessaloniki most historic sights should start right here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a place very close to work and I have tried mostly their coffees and sometimes their sandwiches too. They are both at a very high level. Both their inside environment, and the outside terrace/garden are beautiful and worth visiting. Next stop should be for coctails, as I have heard a lot of good remarks from other friends.\n",

I was excited to try their light roast coffee so I ordered Costa Rica chemex, which they served with sparkling water palate cleanser and biscuits. It was indeed very nice.

It was very busy I have to say, however for someone who also works in a business and knows the drills I was very disappointed to wait 20minutes to place my order and 30minutes to get my coffees. I ordered americano and V60. First one was delicious but V60? not so much... I can live with little over or under extractions but that coffee was too much. It was like licking a tire. Its bitterness was overwhelming. As far as I know, in Greece when you don't like something you can send it back and get something else you will enjoy instead, however discouraged by almost an hour wait I had to leave it as it was. Shame, because the place itself looks really interesting and the combination of bar and speciality coffee is a recipe for success. I would suggest trying a bit of pour-overs before you serve it.\n",

      "Came here after stuffing my face with gyro and ice cream. I wanted something that would help me digest and also refresh me. I had the Don Corleone ehich had apple, pineapple, ginger and spearmint. It was so nice and super tasty. Everything was really fresh and made to order. It definitely helped my stomache feel better and I would recommend this place for any time of the day. They had so many different options and they even serve nice healthy sandwiches.\n",

Even on the build-your-own option you have to include apple or orange. And only some of the ingredients are juiced. Some are blended. At least they had some vegetables though. If they had an all-green vegetable option that was all juiced I would have given them five stars. Still a lot better than most juice bars we come across though, which mostly only offer fruit juices.\n",

My children learned to appreciate liver and mushrooms in this restaurant! There is a choice of dishes with an international ethnic touch, but also with Greek traditional products\n",

      "Since the very first second we were warmly welcomed by Petros and his guys. The food is amongst the best I have tried in Thessaloniki, specially the skewed meatballs, the tabbuleh and the fried rice with vegetables. This place is a must if you are in Thessaloniki and you want to eat proper food with an excellent service\n",

Lovely background music and friendly staff place was buzzing so had to sit inside. Had lovely salads including there own Brusco salad and green salad also had sausages, mackerel a giant pork steak and falafel. Lovely relaxed evening and gorgeous food would thoroughly recommend it, draft white wine was good and a nice selection of bottled beers.\n",

Good atmosphere (we had a table outside as the weather was still nice but the interior seems great as well) polite waiters, the best semi-sweet red wine I have ever had, fresh and tasteful bread. We loved the dessert at the end as well. It would be perfect if the prices were a bit lower.\n",

      "While being in Thessaloniki, I went to this place twice. The first time with 8 friends and the second time with 30 friends (studytrip). The food was delicious and the waiters were very friendly! The atmosphere is good as well, in the northern part of Thessaloniki. All for a very good price. I recommend all to go here.\n",

      "Friendly staff, good location and best Greek salad I’ve had in 5 days Of Greek salads across Greece. A little more than we have paid in similar restaurants, but worth it. The only bone contention was which cheese was the best one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was very slow though there were only 5 tables occupied and most had already eaten. The food was tasteless - nearly revolting - and overpriced. For example the skewered meatballs looked and tasted like cheap fast food. Most of the dishes we left after some bites. For a 0.33 liter beer you pay 4.50 €. We were very disappointed. We paid 42 € for 2 persons and had the impression to have had nothing.\n",

This was probably our best dinner in Thessaloniki. There is a non-smoking section. I recommend following the waiter's suggestions: we did.\n",

First, the staff was overly friendly and helpful, finding us a table within few minutes and serving us in less than ten minutes. The food was excellent, most of the dishes we ordered were served with a matching dipping sauce, the wine was properly cool and as a bonus, we were also served complimentary liqueur shots and dessert at the end of our meal.

The center of the actual cake was dryer than the desert of the Saharah. I wish I had taken a picture of me dropping it in the closest trashbin right at the end of the street. I should’ve taken my €2.80 and flushed them down the toilet. Would’ve gotten more bang for my buck. AVOID!\n",

We went there a month ago, a large group of friends and although we found difficulties to find a table, the staff helped us and after a delay of 15' we were finally sitting inside. The variety of sweets is large and all of them seem delicious. The ones we ordered at least were indeed delicious (oreo cheesecake, cupcake velvet, angel rose, carrot cake, city forest and more...). We had a really great time. The prices are mostly reasonable. It is definitely recommended to everyone, it is an unforgettable experience!!\n",

      "Marvelous decoration, excellent sweets, unfortunately rather limited space, good service and last but not least, one of the few smoke-free cafes in Thessaloniki. We went there a month ago, a large group of friends and although we found difficulties to find a table, the staff helped us and after a delay of 15' we were finally sitting inside. The variety of sweets is large and all of them seem delicious. The ones we ordered at least were indeed delicious (oreo cheesecake, cupcake velvet, angel rose, carrot cake, city forest and more...). We had a really great time. The prices are mostly reasonable. It is definitely recommended to everyone, it is an unforgettable experience!!\n",

      "This is a delicious pastry bakery and cafe. Hidden in a little street, you feel that you are in a 40's movie. Amazing setting, friendly staff but the smells that are coming out of the kitchen are the best. Freshly baked cakes, pastries, cupcakes, tartes, served on their own or with your coffee. Amazing carot cake, nice cheese and ham muffin and so many more. It is a must for your morning coffee or afternoon tea.\n",

Asked for a hot chocolate and got a response that “the coffee/chocolate machines are now shut off”. What a policy!? So I asked the waitress what juices the place had (normally in Greece such shops only have 3-4 basic flavors - not apple - and was interested to know if they had any additional ones) and got the response “whatever juices the market has”. Damn sure if I’d ask for an apple juice we would laugh. My point is, if you want to keep a place until 1am, have polite people to work for you until 1am. If you got a problem with the hours, change it and make it 10pm or something, plus, if you can’t keep your coffee machines on, why have a coffee shop anyway? This place will be my last choice among all the coffee shops in Thessaloniki.\n",

After asking if what i was eating was their definition of medium/rare, and on clearing my half finished plate, not one member of the team came to ask if i wanted anything else. Chef doesnt understand how to cook tuna and front of house dont know customer service.

Completely negative impression! Service was too slow. Smoke got unbearable after 20 minutes. We left half an hour later and went on another wine bar. I would not go back just for a nice decoration.

The staf was polite, if maybe a little rushed. All in all I loved the quiet ambience and the attention to detail both in the decor and the drinks/food. We will definitely come here again.

This cute cafe offers a variety of drinks and sweets. You can have it all: from cocktails to mulled wine. I tried hot chocolate and it was the best chocolate I have ever tasted in my sweet-chocolate-overdosed life.

This is good when the caffe is filled with guests. This way it is just slowing the process to get what you ordered. The wi fi is to complicate to connect.

In the past, this shop used to be one of my favorites, but it has been very long since the last time I was there. I has already noticed, when passing by, the new decoration and style of this coffee shop, aiming to attract students, as it looks like a studying hall. It is still a self service coffee shop, so we ordered a hot chocolate and a cup of coffee and chose to sit on the upper floor, where the only vacant seats were. The tea was extremely hot, so my friend burnt his tongue and was very angry with it. Don't they know that in order to prepare a proper cup of tea the water must not reach the boiling temperature? My chocolate dressed with whipped cream was served without a spoon, which annoyed me. The most irritating issue, though, was that the waiter appeared at 8.45 pm announcing that the upper floor will close in 10 minutes time! I asked him: Are you telling us to leave or will you find us another vacant place in the lower floor? He answered \" I do not know, this is not my job...!\" However, he did return 5 minutes later to inform and show us a table that had just become vacant. I really did not enjoy my stay at this coffee shop, and i do not look forward to return there. In addition, I believe it is still expensive for a cup of tea, coffee or chocolate.\n",

Coffee Lovers enjoy your traditional american coffee, Capuchin, latte or espresso while working or reading or just enjoying the view. You get a password for free wifi! In summer enjoy the wide variety of frappucinos whether coffee based or cream based. They have lovely cheese cakes and cookies that you could enjoy with the coffee too. The only down side is that the service isn't that great.... Servers tend to be a little rude.\n",

      "The prices are a little bit high for coffee, but we have to know that they are selling the brand. However I don't want to be some one who is raining on the parade, the coffee is really good when we forget the price. The service is fast and they obey the rules they have with writing your name on the cup. This was a little bit funny for me since only two of us were next to the cash register. This is good when the caffe is filled with guests. This way it is just slowing the process to get what you ordered. The wi fi is to complicate to connect. They give you the password and username but everything was in Greek lenguage and for some reason my smart phone didn't want to connect. We didn't like the hygiene in the restroom. It could be little better.\n",

And all this without a service (it's self-service) and in paper cups! Not to mention the cookies where not fresh! With this kind of money I could have a feast at a patisserie-cafe. Never ever going again. Get serious with your pricing!\n",

      "I visited this coffee shop with a friend on a Sunday evening to have a cup of coffee or tea and share our news. In the past, this shop used to be one of my favorites, but it has been very long since the last time I was there. I has already noticed, when passing by, the new decoration and style of this coffee shop, aiming to attract students, as it looks like a studying hall. It is still a self service coffee shop, so we ordered a hot chocolate and a cup of coffee and chose to sit on the upper floor, where the only vacant seats were. The tea was extremely hot, so my friend burnt his tongue and was very angry with it. Don't they know that in order to prepare a proper cup of tea the water must not reach the boiling temperature? My chocolate dressed with whipped cream was served without a spoon, which annoyed me. The most irritating issue, though, was that the waiter appeared at 8.45 pm announcing that the upper floor will close in 10 minutes time! I asked him: Are you telling us to leave or will you find us another vacant place in the lower floor? He answered \" I do not know, this is not my job...!\" However, he did return 5 minutes later to inform and show us a table that had just become vacant. I really did not enjoy my stay at this coffee shop, and i do not look forward to return there. In addition, I believe it is still expensive for a cup of tea, coffee or chocolate.\n",

      "With only one person at serving it took 15 minutes to place an order (in a queue of 4). Coffee was boiling hot so I went back to get an ice cube. Waited for 10 minutes in line, and another 5 for the ice cube. Got bored and the coffee would be cool enough soon. No staff to clean up so the place is a mess. Bar stool seats have come off the stool. Terrible, terrible, terrible.\n",

We then went to pay at the counter and they stated we needed to pay with our waitress? So the game continued…we then asked several other individuals if we could pay our bill and they stated they would get the machine…10 more minutes passed and they stood there doing nothing! We finally asked another waitress how to get a bill paid here as we’ve asked at least 4 people and haven’t had any luck..she finally got us taken care of! This was frustrating and time consuming!

All the coffees were delivered with complimentary biscuits. In addition I ordered a cookie biscuit from the menu. It is very popular with the Greeks which is always a good sign and busy. The prices are very affordable and it is good value for money. The service is excellent. Waiters friendly, quick and efficient.

Good art on the walls and probably the best music in town - it ranges from baroque, opera, classical soundtracks and rock. If you are looking for quality, this is your place!\n",
      "\n",
      "I entered and said hello to the staff and asked to use the bathroom before I ordered. I was traveling alone and didn't want to leave my stuff behind while I was in the restroom - I do this all the time and have never had a problem. The man working blocked my entrance and told me \"no\" without any explanation. I further explained that I was going to order a coffee, I just wanted to use the bathroom before I sat down. I tried to explain and make him see that I wanted to order something and stay there but he literally stood by the door holding the door open, motioning for me to leave. He then got angry at me, raising his voice to me and telling me, literally, these words: \"this café is different, this place is not for you.\" From that, I'm guessing he was angry with me because I'm a tourist and I don't speak Greek. I understand 100% a place wanting you to place an order before you use their bathroom but he didn't even give me an opportunity to order and actually kicked me out of the café, embarrassing me in front of all the other guest there. I've traveled to 60 countries in my life and work in the travel industry, and I have never been kicked out of an establishment before even having a chance to order. The man who was working the day of writing this (January 7th) is a complete embarrassment to hospitality and deserves to lose his job or his business if this is how he believes its acceptable to treat customers. An absolute joke. His rudeness ruined my entire day and nearly left me in tears.\n",

      "My husband and I were stopping for a cup of coffee. As I often do, I headed first for the restroom while he found us a seat outside. As I was entering the restroom a male employee grabbed my bag by the strap and used it to yank me out of the restroom. He then pushed himself in front of me to close the bathroom door and told me, “This is not for you.” I said my husband was getting a table that I was a customer and the man gestured for me to leave and said “This is not that kind of place,” before turning his back to me and holding his hand up in my face while doing so. I am an educated professional in her early forties, and was dressed in long black pants, a blouse, and walking shoes. I have never been treated so rudely in a place of business and the experience was humiliating. There was no call for it. People may like the food and drinks, but watch your back if you try to wash your hands before sitting down to enjoy them.\n",

We were very dissapointed, the server or owner are clearly not honest and there was a catalogue of things which we did not like. First of all we came during happy hour where it was advertised on a sign outside and on facebook that it was buy one, get one free on drinks. These were never offered which indicates dishonesty. Secondly the server mentioned that they only accept cash, I found this suspicious. When we ordered Natchos together with our drinks we literally waited 45 minutes, the girl smiled in a weird way and gave no reasonable explanation when asked. It was all very strange, the table next to us had their food after 20 minutes. Then when I paid we were short changed. I didn't see the point of arguing so we left without our natchos, and with a bad feeling. I found out later the English pub is not even run by British, also not a great indication. The next day we found a better pub ran by a British guy in Perea where we will now go frequently.\n",

It was my first morning there after a long flight, and my first morning ever in Greece, so I decided to keep my order simple, and I asked for a decaf coffee with milk. They asked if I wanted medium sugar with it, to which I agreed. They must have pegged me as an American right away. Then they asked if I wanted a frappe. Thinking Starbucks, I said yes. In Greece, that just means over ice. But it was so good, I went back again and got the same thing. Perfect for a warm morning.\n",

      "1. While in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak, the staff was not following any health security measures. The staff's masks did not cover their mouth and nose at any point while serving our food, making us very uncomfortable. Masks should not be just for show or in case an inspection takes place.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Not sufficient social distancing. Tables were too close together, and chairs were literally back to back.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Food was mediocre. The bruschetti were terrible. The bread was not even the average bread you can get at any local bakery shop, it was ready-made sliced bread, the one you get at the supermarket! The beef tagliata was not great either, we were surprised not being asked how we would like it cooked, in fact it was served overdone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it is a nice place to enjoy coffee or drinks with a view, but better spend your money elsewhere for dinner.\n",

      "\n",
      "This place was frustrating. Nice setting, convenient, central, location, good ingredients, very pleasant staff (even if a bit too leisurely, but, hey, not a problem), nice contemporary ambience. We ate there twice, thinking that the over-salting of 3 of our 4 dishes the first night (the fried squid was perfect) would hardly happen again. Next night all four (2 starters, 2 mains) were at least equally over-salted. A mushroom risotto was beautifully flavoured but the overlay of salt made it impossible to finish. Seafood pasta was almost the same. I can only speculate that the chef is a very heavy smoker and so his taste buds need this crazy level of over-seasoning to register. A pity as otherwise the place would be terrific.\n",

      "Ένα Σάββατο αποφάσισα με την παιδική μου φίλη να πάμε για έναν χαλαρό καφέ, φυσικά θέλαμε να κάνουμε κάτι εναλλακτικό. Για αυτό, μετά από αρκετή έρευνα καταλήξαμε στο συγκεκριμένο καφέ με σκοπό την πρόβλεψη του φλιτζανιού αλλα και την ικανοποίηση της ανάγκης μας για καφέ.Αρχικά το ρόφημα που μας σερβιρίστηκε ήταν πλήρως ερασιτεχνικό, όλο το κατακάθι είχε μαζευτεί στην επιφάνεια του φλιτζανιού με αποτέλεσμα ο γλυκός ελληνικός καφές να ήταν άκρως πικρός.\n",
      "\n",
      "Στην συνέχεια αφού ήρθε η ώρα για την πρόβλεψη μας,βγήκαμε έξω στον χώρο στον οποίο πραγματοποιούνται οι χαρτομαντείες καθώς και η ανάγνωση του φλιτζανιού. Η γυναίκα-«μέντιουμ», μας φάνηκε αρκετά περίεργη, δεν τηρούσε τα μέτρα προστασίας λόγω Covid-19 καθώς και κάπνιζε τσιγάρα, τα οποία δημιουργούσαν μια έντονη δυσφορία και στους δυο μας. Στην συνέχεια κατά την διάρκεια της πρόβλεψης διαμόρφωνε και άλλαζε αυτά που έλεγε με βάση τις αντιδράσεις μας τις οποίες προσωπικά προσπάθησα να ελαττώσω με σκοπό να δω αν όντως αυτά που λέει ισχύουν.Αξίζει να σημειωθεί πως η γυναίκα έκανε προσβλητικά αλλά ταυτόχρονος αδιάκριτα σχόλια στην φίλη μου αλλά και πετούσε διαφορά υπονοούμενα που μας έφεραν σε δύσκολη θέση .Σαν να μην φτάνουν αυτά μετά την άστοχη πρόβλεψη η γυναίκα, μας ανάγκασε να δώσουμε επιπλέον χρήματα ως φιλοδώρημα, φυσικά εμείς ως σωστοί πολίτες πάντα αφήνουμε ένα μικρό χρηματικό ποσό όταν έχουμε την χρηματική ευχέρεια, αλλά μετά από αυτήν την δυσάρεστη εμπειρία ήταν το τελευταίο πράγμα που θέλαμε να κάνουμε\n",

Τέλος η φίλη μου επέλεξε να πληρώσει με κάρτα, ο άντρας, μας είπε πως σε περίπτωση πληρωμής με κάρτα η χρέωση είναι+ 0,20€ κάτι το οποίο δεν ήταν δίκαιο και ηθικό από την στιγμή που καταναλώσαμε το ίδιο προϊών σε ίδια ποσότητα, να χρεωθεί παραπάνω\n",

Όταν έφτασε η στιγμή να πληρώσουμε, ζήτησαν από όλους, ακόμα και από το άτομο που δεν του είπαν το φλιτζάνι, 4€. Ζήτησα να πληρώσω με κάρτα και μου είπαν ότι με κάρτα όταν πληρώνεις χρεώνεσαι 0.20€ παραπάνω, το οποίο δεν μου έχει συμβεί ξανά. Ευγενική συμπεριφορά από το προσωπικό παρόλα αυτά.

It was very busy I have to say, however for someone who also works in a business and knows the drills I was very disappointed to wait 20minutes to place my order and 30minutes to get my coffees. I ordered americano and V60. First one was delicious but V60? not so much... I can live with little over or under extractions but that coffee was too much. It was like licking a tire. Its bitterness was overwhelming. As far as I know, in Greece when you don't like something you can send it back and get something else you will enjoy instead, however discouraged by almost an hour wait I had to leave it as it was. Shame, because the place itself looks really interesting and the combination of bar and speciality coffee is a recipe for success.

I was excited to try their light roast coffee so I ordered Costa Rica chemex, which they served with sparkling water palate cleanser and biscuits. It was indeed very nice. Encouraged by my first visit I decided to go again on a Sunday. It was very busy I have to say, however for someone who also works in a business and knows the drills I was very disappointed to wait 20minutes to place my order and 30minutes to get my coffees. I ordered americano and V60. First one was delicious but V60? not so much... I can live with little over or under extractions but that coffee was too much. It was like licking a tire. Its bitterness was overwhelming. As far as I know, in Greece when you don't like something you can send it back and get something else you will enjoy instead, however discouraged by almost an hour wait I had to leave it as it was. Shame, because the place itself looks really interesting and the combination of bar and speciality coffee is a recipe for success. I would suggest trying a bit of pour-overs before you serve it.\", 'Rating': 3.0}, {'Business_name': 'The Blue Cup', 'Username': 'Ljuba K\\nSofia, Bulgaria', 'Review Date': 'October 20, 2016', 'Visit Date': 'October 2016', 'Review Title': 'Nice atmosphere, excellent music, cozy interior', 'Review Text': 'Excellent place to have a drink after dinner in Thessaloniki.

So I asked the waitress what juices the place had (normally in Greece such shops only have 3-4 basic flavors - not apple - and was interested to know if they had any additional ones) and got the response “whatever juices the market has”. Damn sure if I’d ask for an apple juice we would laugh. My point is, if you want to keep a place until 1am, have polite people to work for you until 1am. If you got a problem with the hours, change it and make it 10pm or something, plus, if you can’t keep your coffee machines on, why have a coffee shop anyway?

In the past, this shop used to be one of my favorites, but it has been very long since the last time I was there. I has already noticed, when passing by, the new decoration and style of this coffee shop, aiming to attract students, as it looks like a studying hall. It is still a self service coffee shop, so we ordered a hot chocolate and a cup of coffee and chose to sit on the upper floor, where the only vacant seats were. The tea was extremely hot, so my friend burnt his tongue and was very angry with it. Don\\'t they know that in order to prepare a proper cup of tea the water must not reach the boiling temperature? My chocolate dressed with whipped cream was served without a spoon, which annoyed me. The most irritating issue, though, was that the waiter appeared at 8.45 pm announcing that the upper floor will close in 10 minutes time! I asked him: Are you telling us to leave or will you find us another vacant place in the lower floor? He answered \" I do not know, this is not my job...!\" However, he did return 5 minutes later to inform and show us a table that had just become vacant. I really did not enjoy my stay at this coffee shop, and i do not look forward to return there.

In the past, this shop used to be one of my favorites, but it has been very long since the last time I was there. I has already noticed, when passing by, the new decoration and style of this coffee shop, aiming to attract students, as it looks like a studying hall. It is still a self service coffee shop, so we ordered a hot chocolate and a cup of coffee and chose to sit on the upper floor, where the only vacant seats were. The tea was extremely hot, so my friend burnt his tongue and was very angry with it. Don\\'t they know that in order to prepare a proper cup of tea the water must not reach the boiling temperature? My chocolate dressed with whipped cream was served without a spoon, which annoyed me. The most irritating issue, though, was that the waiter appeared at 8.45 pm announcing that the upper floor will close in 10 minutes time! I asked him: Are you telling us to leave or will you find us another vacant place in the lower floor? He answered \" I do not know, this is not my job...!\" However, he did return 5 minutes later to inform and show us a table that had just become vacant. I really did not enjoy my stay at this coffee shop, and i do not look forward to return there.

We stopped in for beverages and a tasty treat. The service was poor and food was just okay compared to other places we have eaten here. They brought our bill to the table and we gave our credit card to the waitress and she stated she would be back. We then waited over 20 min and she never returned. We then went to pay at the counter and they stated we needed to pay with our waitress? So the game continued…we then asked several other individuals if we could pay our bill and they stated they would get the machine…10 more minutes passed and they stood there doing nothing! We finally asked another waitress how to get a bill paid here as we’ve asked at least 4 people and haven’t had any luck..she finally got us taken care of! This was frustrating and time consuming!

The waitress took soooo long to bring the water the menu and wanted an order before she even gave me one! Was snappy in attitude and only attended the table once whilst there, the rest of the time she stood chatting to a customer about the best hot spots to go to at night and on the weekend instead of checking on her tables. She left the work for the other waiters and it was frustrating to watch that she had a job that someone else could be doing a better job at. I timed her and she actually stood there for 30 minutes I'm not sure why the day manager never got onto her, but made for an unpleasant visit to that particular cafe. The one in town was impeccable and the service more than fantastic. We tipped the boys very well they deserved it.

The waitress took soooo long to bring the water the menu and wanted an order before she even gave me one!

She left the work for the other waiters and it was frustrating to watch that she had a job that someone else could be doing a better job at. I timed her and she actually stood there for 30 minutes I'm not sure why the day manager never got onto her, but made for an unpleasant visit to that particular cafe. The one in town was impeccable and the service more than fantastic. We tipped the boys very well they deserved it.

Nice setting, convenient, central, location, good ingredients, very pleasant staff (even if a bit too leisurely, but, hey, not a problem), nice contemporary ambience. We ate there twice, thinking that the over-salting of 3 of our 4 dishes the first night (the fried squid was perfect) would hardly happen again. Next night all four (2 starters, 2 mains) were at least equally over-salted. A mushroom risotto was beautifully flavoured but the overlay of salt made it impossible to finish. Seafood pasta was almost the same. I can only speculate that the chef is a very heavy smoker and so his taste buds need this crazy level of over-seasoning to register.
