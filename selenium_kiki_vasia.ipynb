      "Business Name: The Blue Cup\n",
      "In my opinion it is the best place in Thessaloniki for coffee. They have a variety of coffee beans and blends from around the world. Uniquely styled coffee drinks and an excellent house espresso. They also serve other things prepared with the same care and delicacy. The staff is welcoming and polite. In the beginning the place may not look like much but as you sit and enjoy, you understand how special it is. Their selection of alcoholic drinks is as well something to be remarked. Here you can find your new taste but be careful cause then you may no longer be satisfied with other places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee is very good and the staff is very friendly. The space is also very well decorated. We tried three types of coffee and all of them were impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great service and coffee for a real coffee lovers ☕️🧁👌🏻One of the best place in Thessaloniki! Food was perfect. Price was 👌🏻\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommended by our son, who really knows his coffee. The Blue Cup is well positioned, just on the edge of the Ladadika district. They have an extensive menu of different coffees beans & extraction techniques. Presentation was equally impressive, likened to an old victorian apothecary. All senses were taken on a journey to ensure an enjoyable experience. One of the best!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blue Cup would be a hipster speciality-coffee heaven if it weren’t for its location in the very commercially touristy heart of the City. It’s no surprise, considering how brilliant the coffee is after the research I made before the visit. Carefully sourced Brazilian and Ethiopia single-origin roasts and a two-bean blend from Costa Rica and Panama have been alloted to cold filter, espresso and milk-based drinks respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Blue Cup is probably dominating the artisan coffee game in this city. The coffee is made slowly and very precisely, and the extensive menu goes beyond espresso-based drinks – there’s also a lovingly curated list of cold filter coffees on offer at the brew bar which changes depending of coffee imports they have.\n",
      "A day exploring Thessaloniki most historic sights should start right here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a place very close to work and I have tried mostly their coffees and sometimes their sandwiches too. They are both at a very high level. Both their inside environment, and the outside terrace/garden are beautiful and worth visiting. Next stop should be for coctails, as I have heard a lot of good remarks from other friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect atmosphere, excellent service and extremelly friendly staff, particularly a young guy with curly black hair (it's a pity we did not get his name). They surely have the best quality coffee. Highly recommended place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally the third wave is here. Cozy place, nice music, friendly staff but most of all the best coffee in town. Why? You can find variety, know-how and single origin coffee!\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited this place a couple days ago and it was wonderful! The service was very fast and always willing to help you. The music was the best for a casual night and the quality of their cocktails was remarkable. In conclusion, totally a place to visit!\n",
      "\n",
      "No many words for this bar in the heart of Thessaloniki Such a lovely staff! The atmosphere it's calm and relaxing And definitely I can recommend cocktails from the best bartender Vaggelis !\n",
      "\n",
      "If you love coffee and you want to try something different than a usual coffee, come here! They also serve cold brew and single origin brews every day different!!! Just love it\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I had bought the Junk Girl and it was a superb cocktail, unique and one of a kind. The atmosphere as well as the creative decor was also enjoyable to look at while outside enjoying our drinks. Highly recommend,\n",

      "Great and cosy coffee place in Thessaloniki. They roast their own blends, really pro coffee experts. Friendly and cheap.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Both serve elegant and fancy coctails. Blue cap on the ground floor with its lively atmosphere, and the Speakeasy bar, a hidden gem on the upper floor for those seeking privacy and old school American style. Whatever you may choose, you won't be dissapointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though I put hot chocolate photo, the coffee is the best. I know lots of foreigners who buy bags of coffee here and taking it back home. Love the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me and my friend searched for a place in Thessaloniki where we can get some special and good coctails when we found this place. When we saw the decoration and felt the atmosphere here we immediately knew that this is a must try place. And didn't dissapoint us.. the service was amazingly fast, our waiter was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed and made sure we are satisfied.\n",
      "About the coctails: we tried a few of them. Still not dissapointed. They have a menu with pictures of the drinks and what you get is looks just the same good as in the pics and all of what we tried was tasted very good.\n",
      "So unique atmosphere in the heart of Thessaloniki with great service and good drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived, the waiter turned and looked at us in a very unpleasant way, like we were doing something wrong. I said we were here for a drink and was that OK? He said \"Excuse me?\" as if I'd said something completely ridiculous. I didn't know how to respond, so we continued and he followed us in and talked to the bartender in Greek as he made our (very expensive!) drinks. I don't know what he was saying, but he was gesturing towards us and the bartender was laughing awkwardly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we had our drinks, we went outside and tried to find a seat. We saw someone sitting alone with 3 empty seats by him, and went over and asked if we could take the spare seats. He said there was someone sitting opposite, so we asked to take the two seats next to them, and he said \"Sorry, it's for 2 people.\" So we said, \"Well, if we don't use the table, can we please take the chairs?\" he said that was OK, so we pulled the seats a short distance from the table and sat down, already feeling very awkward. His friend came out and started gesturing at us and shouting. The waiter came out and told us to move to a different table. We had done absolutely nothing wrong and not attempted to bother these people in anyway, just wanted to sit in nearby seats. The waiter was talking to them in an apologetic tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "We finished our drinks and left as quickly as possible, feeling like we'd been thoroughly rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "We visited The Blue Cup for breakfast and we loved it. The atmosphere of the coffee shop was lovely, really nice for taking pictures and just enjoying the moment. Since I am a vegan, there wasn't anything for me to eat for breakfast neither they had a plant based milk so I only got a black coffee but like I said the overall experience was really nice. Also the waiters serving us were very friendly:)\n",

      "\n",
      "I definitely recommend trying an espresso and a flat white.. The coffee is freshly roasted and the staff is really nice and helpful. It also looks really good\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a good place for coffee or drinks. I tried their cold brew and it was good (not very good though) They also provide roasted beans but when I was there they had some 15 days old roastings so I didn't bought them. A roastery should always had fresh roastings. Still I liked the place\n",

      "\n",
      "Even though I put hot chocolate photo, the coffee is the best. I know lots of foreigners who buy bags of coffee here and taking it back home. Love the place.\n",

      "Me and my friend searched for a place in Thessaloniki where we can get some special and good coctails when we found this place. When we saw the decoration and felt the atmosphere here we immediately knew that this is a must try place. And didn't dissapoint us.. the service was amazingly fast, our waiter was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed and made sure we are satisfied.\n",
      "About the coctails: we tried a few of them. Still not dissapointed. They have a menu with pictures of the drinks and what you get is looks just the same good as in the pics and all of what we tried was tasted very good.\n",
      "So unique atmosphere in the heart of Thessaloniki with great service and good drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived, the waiter turned and looked at us in a very unpleasant way, like we were doing something wrong. I said we were here for a drink and was that OK? He said \"Excuse me?\" as if I'd said something completely ridiculous. I didn't know how to respond, so we continued and he followed us in and talked to the bartender in Greek as he made our (very expensive!) drinks. I don't know what he was saying, but he was gesturing towards us and the bartender was laughing awkwardly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we had our drinks, we went outside and tried to find a seat. We saw someone sitting alone with 3 empty seats by him, and went over and asked if we could take the spare seats. He said there was someone sitting opposite, so we asked to take the two seats next to them, and he said \"Sorry, it's for 2 people.\" So we said, \"Well, if we don't use the table, can we please take the chairs?\" he said that was OK, so we pulled the seats a short distance from the table and sat down, already feeling very awkward. His friend came out and started gesturing at us and shouting. The waiter came out and told us to move to a different table. We had done absolutely nothing wrong and not attempted to bother these people in anyway, just wanted to sit in nearby seats. The waiter was talking to them in an apologetic tone.\n",

      "We visited The Blue Cup for breakfast and we loved it. The atmosphere of the coffee shop was lovely, really nice for taking pictures and just enjoying the moment. Since I am a vegan, there wasn't anything for me to eat for breakfast neither they had a plant based milk so I only got a black coffee but like I said the overall experience was really nice. Also the waiters serving us were very friendly:)\n",

      "This is a good place for coffee or drinks. I tried their cold brew and it was good (not very good though) They also provide roasted beans but when I was there they had some 15 days old roastings so I didn't bought them. A roastery should always had fresh roastings. Still I liked the place\n",

      "My first experience with Blue Cup was quite good. I was excited to try their light roast coffee so I ordered Costa Rica chemex, which they served with sparkling water palate cleanser and biscuits. It was indeed very nice. Encouraged by my first visit I decided to go again on a Sunday. It was very busy I have to say, however for someone who also works in a business and knows the drills I was very disappointed to wait 20minutes to place my order and 30minutes to get my coffees. I ordered americano and V60. First one was delicious but V60? not so much... I can live with little over or under extractions but that coffee was too much. It was like licking a tire. Its bitterness was overwhelming. As far as I know, in Greece when you don't like something you can send it back and get something else you will enjoy instead, however discouraged by almost an hour wait I had to leave it as it was. Shame, because the place itself looks really interesting and the combination of bar and speciality coffee is a recipe for success. I would suggest trying a bit of pour-overs before you serve it.\n",

The cafe was very spacey & calm on the inside; it also had outdoor seats but those were crowded with smokers. A number of specialty coffees were on display but only one ‘coffee of the day’ was offered in the brew-bar. I ordered that one in a Chemex -- it was an Ethiopia, can't remember its full name -- it felt oddly spicy but definitely was not bad. I also bought a pack of beans of a different sort, the Ethiopian Mocca, and this one proved truly stellar when I brewed it at home. All in all, the place is definitely worth it.\n",

That definitely ruined my mood though especially when I saw how much sauce she put in the salad which, by the way, had also SUGAR in for no apparent reason! This place considering itself HEALTHY?? I don’t think so! Salad wasn’t very nice either! Quinoa with tons of sauce chicken and tiny bits of carrot and zucchini horrible taste, not healthy at all, very rude girl !!\n",

Even on the build-your-own option you have to include apple or orange. And only some of the ingredients are juiced. Some are blended. At least they had some vegetables though. If they had an all-green vegetable option that was all juiced I would have given them five stars. Still a lot better than most juice bars we come across though, which mostly only offer fruit juices.\n",

We travelled with a Gluten-free member of our party and this was the only place in Thessaloniki that we could find that offered gluten-free sandwiches.

      "Will totally visit again!\n",

      "We were happy to see this juice bar. Nice selection for the most part, but like most juice bars we come across there were no vegetable-only options. Even on the build-your-own option you have to include apple or orange. And only some of the ingredients are juiced. Some are blended. At least they had some vegetables though. If they had an all-green vegetable option that was all juiced I would have given them five stars. Still a lot better than most juice bars we come across though, which mostly only offer fruit juices.\n",

      "\n",
      "Perfection!!! We loved everything about Join the Juice! We travelled with a Gluten-free member of our party and this was the only place in Thessaloniki that we could find that offered gluten-free sandwiches.

My children learned to appreciate liver and mushrooms in this restaurant! There is a choice of dishes with an international ethnic touch, but also with Greek traditional products\n",
      "\n",

Lovely background music and friendly staff place was buzzing so had to sit inside.

Good atmosphere (we had a table outside as the weather was still nice but the interior seems great as well) polite waiters, the best semi-sweet red wine I have ever had, fresh and tasteful bread. We loved the dessert at the end as well. It would be perfect if the prices were a bit lower.\n",

      "Friendly staff, good location and best Greek salad I’ve had in 5 days Of Greek salads across Greece. A little more than we have paid in similar restaurants, but worth it. The only bone contention was which cheese was the best one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was very slow though there were only 5 tables occupied and most had already eaten. The food was tasteless - nearly revolting - and overpriced. For example the skewered meatballs looked and tasted like cheap fast food. Most of the dishes we left after some bites. For a 0.33 liter beer you pay 4.50 €. We were very disappointed. We paid 42 € for 2 persons and had the impression to have had nothing.\n",

      "I stopped mid afternoon, hot from walking up to Anopoli. The staff were friendly and the outside seating area really nice, looking out at the old city walls. I came on my own but I think it is best if you are not alone as the dishes work well for sharing and then you can try several things which will make for a nicer meal. The name of the restaurant probably gives this away.\n",

      "This is not a good choice for a business lunch or dinner: totally unprofessional attitude, and huge problem with providing a proper invoice / payment procedure\n",
      "\n",
      "By coincidence we came accross this place and had lunch and came back for dinner the next day. Nicely situated near the castle wall, quiet. They have a large choice of nice small dishes and we would have come back again if they would not have closed the weekend to get some painting work done. We were offered a free glass of limoncello for desert too, they made us feel really welcome. Good value for money!\n",

First, the staff was overly friendly and helpful, finding us a table within few minutes and serving us in less than ten minutes. The food was excellent, most of the dishes we ordered were served with a matching dipping sauce, the wine was properly cool and as a bonus, we were also served complimentary liqueur shots and dessert at the end of our meal. Overall a very nice experience, definitely recommended!\n",

      "If you are in Ana Poli near the castle walls, head hear. Nothing spectacular but stylish, friendly and good mezzos a notch or 2 above the ordinary.\n",

      "Nice cheap modern greek cuisine. Not something exceptional but everything is above average and the prices are good. Definitely recommended\n",
      "\n",
      "I stopped mid afternoon, hot from walking up to Anopoli. The staff were friendly and the outside seating area really nice, looking out at the old city walls. I came on my own but I think it is best if you are not alone as the dishes work well for sharing and then you can try several things which will make for a nicer meal. The name of the restaurant probably gives this away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tired of going up the hill in the summer heat we ended up in this lovely bar with spacious beer garden. The atmosphere is calm as well as the surrounding. No one in the hurry. We got some refreshing beers and so tasteful raki with a hint of honey. Lovely staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a good choice for a business lunch or dinner: totally unprofessional attitude, and huge problem with providing a proper invoice / payment procedure\n",
      "\n",
      "By coincidence we came accross this place and had lunch and came back for dinner the next day. Nicely situated near the castle wall, quiet. They have a large choice of nice small dishes and we would have come back again if they would not have closed the weekend to get some painting work done. We were offered a free glass of limoncello for desert too, they made us feel really welcome. Good value for money!\n",
      "\n",
      "Very convenient location, the food is very tasty, and especially the french fries are bursting in flavour! The staff are very polite and are very helpful! And it's a place you have to visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent location at Eptapyrgio, hidden behind the Kastra walls. Food, however, is average - not bad, but nothing to remember. The place is very popular with locals for the weekend and has lively atmosphere, sometimes too noisy.\n",

      "I hate myself, because in beginning I want wrote bad comment, because I don't feel comfortable. But these restaurant knows how make 5 stars ✨.\n",

      "This was our second visit to the area, after having tried another nearby place. I have to say i am totally satisfied for a number of reasons. First, the staff was overly friendly and helpful, finding us a table within few minutes and serving us in less than ten minutes. The food was excellent, most of the dishes we ordered were served with a matching dipping sauce, the wine was properly cool and as a bonus, we were also served complimentary liqueur shots and dessert at the end of our meal. Overall a very nice experience, definitely recommended!\n",
      "Recommended by Greek acquaintance, this place was clearly very popular with local people. It serves what, I believe, referred to as \"small plates\", that is what might be considered the equivalent of pub food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flood is good. There is a lonely terrace facing the impressive Byzantine walls. The service was friendly and efficient. Prices very reasonable. The surrounding area is very lively and fun to visit. Good place to get a feel for real life in Thessaloniki.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all we met the exciting environment around the restaurant, opposite of the ancient walls of the city, in front of a green park and we felt as part of the anccient history of this town. After we faced the smiling faces of the friendly company where they are working there and they willing to serve you, we tasted the unusual and very tasty, local appetises - plates, cooked (as we found out) by the experienced chef's hands. The ouners also, became part of the big friently warm company and they realy wanted to serve you as better as they can. We left the restaurant, feeling full of positive feelings, paying very normal prices. Thank you all in Brusco.\n",
      "\n",
      "we visited the place for lunch. the prices are mediumrange, the quality quite good and the location great. we tried the ouzo meze for 5,5 euro (worth it ), a salad 6,5 euro potatoes brava style (very big portion fr the price) and 3 euro for a glass of a nice organic malagouzia (expensive ). the place is in front of the old walls and a park, and you could here the birds singing.\n",

      "We tried three different types of cakes and they were all great. We also had coffee and it was good, quite a bit stronger than most so maybe be careful if you don't like strong coffee. Perhaps a bit pricey in general but not at all compared to the area.\n",
      "The staff was polite and could communicate in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "A decent non-commercial store with good sweet pastry and playful combinations.\n",
      "Compared to other sweet pastry stores around it offers you exactly what it's supposed to consistently without fluffy tags of free from...almost everything.\n",
      "'No sugar' - 'No milk' - 'No pastry' - 'No dough'\n",
      "Be realistic, you choose a sweet pastry store to eat a sweet pastry product!\n",

      "The only thing noticed is the staff's attitude, smile, and be polite. Nothing else is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a cake for my young son 4 days before his birthday. Our communication was written via email and everything was supposed to be organized but we were left without cake!!! Their behavior was so bad, insulting and rude they didn’t even apologize for the inconvenience. We found out that we had no cake at the day of his birthday. Pour little guy was so upset and cried so much because he was expecting the cake he chose.\n",
      "I definitely not recommend that shop to anybody!!!!!\n",
      "Completely unprofessional!\n",

      "\n",
      "Was walking by sugar angel with my friend & stopped in for a cupcake. Big mistake!! We got a vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting that was easily a week old. How do we know, you ask? The center of the actual cake was dryer than the desert of the Saharah. I wish I had taken a picture of me dropping it in the closest trashbin right at the end of the street. I should’ve taken my €2.80 and flushed them down the toilet. Would’ve gotten more bang for my buck. AVOID!\n",

      "\n",
      "I keep visiting this place whenever I crave for something sweet. Although it is quiet small and most of the times it is not easy to find a table, the atmosphere is great and the pastries are really awesome. My favourite is the cheesecake oreo, which I strongly recommend.\n",

      "Too over-crowded especially at peak times. Still you should try it earlier in the morning for a coffee and a pastry delice. You should take the Greek coffee, although it looks like a cappuccino fits more to the place. Choose freely one of the house cakes. They are all fresh, handmade and delicious. I suggest the coconut cake or the noisete.\n",

Τα μισά είναι ροτόντες κάτι το οποίο είναι πολυ ωραίο για φαγητό. Η Νικολέττα και το προσωπικό πολύ ευγενικοί τηρώντας τα υγειονομικά πρωτόκολλα. Στο δια ταύτα τώρα. Μεγάλη ποικιλία στον κατάλογο με αρκετές επιλογές για όλα τα γούστα. Ότι πήραμε ήταν νόστιμο και καλομαγειρεμένο. Εξαιρετικό κριθαρώτο, κοτοτηγανιά, κεμπαπακια και ανατολίτικο κοτόπουλο. Οι τηγανιτές πατάτες must. Τιμές κανονικές προς χαμηλές. Σίγουρα θα ξαναπάμε.\n",

      "Δεν ξέρω που βρήκαν οι υπόλοιποι τη \"φιλική\" εξυπηρέτηση, εμείς πήγαμε Σάββατο βράδυ, δύο άτομα και καθήσαμε σε ένα μικρό τραπέζι που φαινόταν ότι δεν είχε κράτηση καθώς δίπλα ακριβώς υπήρχε άλλο, μεγαλύτερο, με μπουκάλι επάνω.\n",
      "Πέντε λεπτά μετά ένας νεαρός μας ρώτησε πόσα άτομα θα είμαστε και αν χρειαζόμαστε σταχτοδοχείο, και άλλα πέντε λεπτά μετά ήρθε -μάλλον η ιδιοκτήτρια - να μας πει ότι δεν μπορεί να μας εξυπηρετήσει γιατί το τραπέζι ήταν κρατημένο. Που - μέχρι εδώ - είναι ανθρώπινο, κάναν λάθος που δεν έβαλαν ρεζερβέ. Ωστόσο συνέχισε λέγοντας μας ότι θα μπορούσε να μας βολέψει μεν αλλά πέσαν οι κρατήσεις όλες μαζί και αν μείνουμε θα φάμε στις 12 το βράδυ! Αναρωτιέμαι: τα κρατημένα τραπέζια θα τρώγαν κι αυτά στις 12 τη νύχτα; Θα τους έλεγε το ίδιο;\n",

Αυτές οι τιμές αντιστοιχούν σε \"κανονικές\" μερίδες φαγητού και σαλατών, αλλιώς πρόκειται για \"μεζεδάκια\" και χρειάζεται γενναία αναπροσαρμογη των τιμών αλλιώς των ποσοτήτων.

Asked for a hot chocolate and got a response that “the coffee/chocolate machines are now shut off”. What a policy!? So I asked the waitress what juices the place had (normally in Greece such shops only have 3-4 basic flavors - not apple - and was interested to know if they had any additional ones) and got the response “whatever juices the market has”. Damn sure if I’d ask for an apple juice we would laugh. My point is, if you want to keep a place until 1am, have polite people to work for you until 1am. If you got a problem with the hours, change it and make it 10pm or something, plus, if you can’t keep your coffee machines on, why have a coffee shop anyway? This place will be my last choice among all the coffee shops in Thessaloniki.\n",

      "We went there for drinks. The cocktail which was a signature cocktail was described as sour, but it was sweet and not good at all, so I wouldn't recommend it. The glass of wine on the online menu, that was on the QR code on the table and was the only one provided, was priced at 7€, but they charged it for 8€. When I asked why, they said the menu was old. I asked, what do you mean old, it's an online site that you show people through a qr code on the table. Shouldn't it contain the right price? The reply was, yes, you're right and then went to the supervisor and came back with a menu that contained the new price. Talk about professionalism...\n",

Not over priced, with some good offers on weekdays. Totally recommended.\n",

      "Part of the old baths are visible as you enter, go upstairs to look out over the top of the building, we had dry white wine at 4 euros each glass, waiter/ress service with nuts/crisps.\n",
      "It was about 30 degrees at 6pm, so we sat in the shade, but returned about 10.30pm for a cocktail each (it was super busy) the bath roofs are 'lit up' a bit ultra violet looking. A trendy bar which is well worth visiting at all times of the day. Some seats downstairs and a couple outside too.\n",

You can go rooftop to look over the old domes or sit inside and peer into the ancient boilers or enjoy the soft breezes outdoors while in the heart of the city. The usual choices for coffees, nothing very different than elsewhere in the city but the ambiance is priceless.\n",

      "Very crowded. The personnel didn't even think to take a look inside to see if people were too tight. Therefore we ended up being toooo many people inside and as a result you couldn't even talk with your friends without getting interrupted to move aside so other people can pass. People were going in circles inside the shop and were always bumping onto you. Overall experience was 4/10 . Mediocre drinks , not very young people. Mediocre music also.\n",

      "Just across the road from our hotel a busy trendy spot. The prices were OK for a large tapas type portions€8 and Prosecco €26 .All the bar staff were helpful.To get a decent seat outside arrive by 8.30.Great vibe/music from Chilai and surrounding restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discrimination, lies, ignorance, and awful service.\n",
      "They should know better how to handle customers and get on with the program- turning away randomly people by saying “reservations only”, is kinda really pathetic customer service (when clearly the whole place was empty inside). Poor judgment of potential good “spenders” :-)\n",

      "Ordered the tuna fillet with grilled vegetables off the menu. At the time of ordering, i was asked “how would you like your tuna? Medium? Medium/rare? Medium/well done?”.... Ordered medium/rare.... Obviously this had no meaning to the chef and what was presented was a very well done piece of tuna. After asking if what i was eating was their definition of medium/rare, and on clearing my half finished plate, not one member of the team came to ask if i wanted anything else. Chef doesnt understand how to cook tuna and front of house dont know customer service. Choose one of the many other establishments on this street, i can’t believe they would offer an experience like Chilea did. Pictures added to judge for yourself if you would accept this as medium to rare tuna.\n",

And the place wasn’t even crowded!!\n",

We had no reservation and after 7 minutes they finally found us some space in the bar but when I took out my coat to sit...the Public Relations girl, took away my chair! Completely negative impression! Service was too slow. Smoke got unbearable after 20 minutes. We left half an hour later and went on another wine bar. I would not go back just for a nice decoration. It's 2018 and in some days it will be 2019. Wake up!\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent environment and smoke free inside at least at summer! Staff is not very friendly but service is quick! We wanted to go again but we were told by other customers that smoking inside is aloud in winter. You have to confirm if the no smoking law is abided\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been attracted by a stunning atmosphere in the bar and surrounding.\n",
      "The place itself is really great but their cocktails were not up to the location. I went there on 3 occasions and I would say only 1 cocktail out of 4 was acceptable, one literally was juice only and the 2 others were served in a big glass, not weak but full of ice. I still recommend this place for different drinks than cocktails.\n",

The cafe was very spacey & calm on the inside; it also had outdoor seats but those were crowded with smokers. A number of specialty coffees were on display but only one ‘coffee of the day’ was offered in the brew-bar. I ordered that one in a Chemex -- it was an Ethiopia, can't remember its full name -- it felt oddly spicy but definitely was not bad. I also bought a pack of beans of a different sort, the Ethiopian Mocca, and this one proved truly stellar when I brewed it at home.
